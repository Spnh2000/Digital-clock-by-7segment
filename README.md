# Digital-clock-by-7segment
Digital clock by 7segment, Simulation in Proteus and c code in code vision.

Hardware of this experiment has six seven-segment displays. 
To display each of the cases, hours, minutes, and seconds, two seven-segment numbers are used. 
The clock starts working from the time 23:58:00.
The decimal points of the units digits are turned on in even seconds and off in odd seconds.

(Please ensure that you adjust the reset circuit. I didn't set it in simulation.)

(If you are unable to open the Proteus file, please use the provided picture to draw the simulation in Proteus.
Then, add the hex file located in 'Digital clock by 7 segment c code\Debug\Exe')
